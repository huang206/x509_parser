X509 certificate parsing and data processing for machine learning research
This is a project which focused on searching over the Internet for millions of websites to collect their certificates
and do data processing on these certificates to prepare them for machine learning.
The x509 parser model is built on https://github.com/hiviah/pyx509.
Thanks a lot
